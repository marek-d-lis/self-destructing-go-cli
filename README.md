# 🗑️ Self-Destructing Go CLI Tool

This is a fun **Go-based CLI tool** that deletes itself after printing a message. Run it once, and watch it vanish!

## 🚀 How to Use

### **1️⃣ Download the latest binary**
Grab the latest release from the **[Releases](https://github.com/your-username/self-destructing-go-cli/releases)** page.

Alternatively, you can build it from source:

### **2️⃣ Build from Source**
```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/self-destructing-go-cli.git
cd self-destructing-go-cli

# Build the binary (Linux example)
go build -o self_destruct

# Run it
./self_destruct
```

### **3️⃣ Run the Binary**
```sh
./self_destruct
```

The script will print a message, wait a moment, and then delete itself.

## ⚠️ Warning

This tool **actually deletes itself** after execution! If you want to test it multiple times, make sure to **download it again or rebuild it**.

Enjoy watching your program disappear! 🚀😆
